Warlock’s Curse
Once per turn as a minor action, you can place a
Warlock’s Curse on the enemy nearest to you that
you can see. A cursed enemy is more vulnerable to
your attacks. If you damage a cursed enemy, you deal
extra damage. You decide whether to apply the extra
damage after making the damage roll. You can deal
this extra damage once per round.
 A Warlock’s Curse remains in effect until the end of
the encounter or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit
points or fewer.
 You can place a Warlock’s Curse on multiple targets
over the course of an encounter; each curse requires
the use of a minor action. You can’t place a Warlock’s
Curse on a creature that is already affected by your or
another character’s Warlock’s Curse. As you advance in 
level, your extra damage increases

Implements
Warlocks make use of rods and wands to help channel
and direct their arcane powers. A warlock wielding
a magic rod or wand can add its enhancement bonus
to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of warlock
powers, as well as warlock paragon path powers,
that have the implement keyword. Without a rod or
a wand, a warlock can still use these powers, but he
or she doesn’t gain the bonus provided by the magic
implement.
 A pact blade, a special magic dagger, can also be
used as an implement for warlock powers, as well as
warlock paragon powers.
