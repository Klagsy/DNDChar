Divine Challenge
At-Will * Divine, Radiant
Minor Action			Close Burst 5
Target: One creature in burst
Effect: You mark the target. The target remains marked un-
 til you use this power against another target, or if you fail
 to engage the target (see below). A creature can be subject
 to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a 
 mark that was already in place.
   While a target is marked, it takes a -2 penalty to attack
 rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target.
 Also, it takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma
 modifier the first time it makes an attack that doesn't in-
 clude you as a target before the start of your next turn. The
 damage increases to 6 + your Charisma at 11th level
 and to 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st leve.
   On your turn, you must engage the target you chal-
 lenged or challenge a different target. To engage the
 target, you must either attack it or end your turn adjacent
 to it. If none of these events occur by the end of your turn,
 the marked condition ends and you can't use divine chal-
 lenge on your next turn.
   you can use divine challenge once per turn
Special: Even though this ability is called a challenge, it
 doesn't rely on the intelligence or language ability of the
 target. It's a magical compulsion that affects the creature;s
 behaviour, regardless of the creature's nature. You can't place
  a divine challenge on a creature that is already affected by
  your or another character's divine challenge.
