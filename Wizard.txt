Arcane Implement Mastery
Choose one of the following forms of implement mastery.
  Orb of Imposition: Once per encounter as a free
action, you can use your orb to gain one of the following
two effects.
 You can designate one creature you have cast a
wizard spell upon that has an effect that lasts until
the subject succeeds on a saving throw. That creature
takes a penalty to its saving throws against that effect
equal to your Wisdom modifier.
 Alternatively, you can choose to extend the duration
of an effect created by a wizard at-will spell (such as
cloud of daggers or ray of frost) that would otherwise end
at the end of your current turn. The effect instead ends
at the end of your next turn.
 You must wield an orb to use this ability. Control
wizards select this form of mastery because it helps
extend the duration of their control effects.
Staff of Defense: A staff of defense grants you
a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, once per encounter
as an immediate interrupt, you gain a bonus to
defense against one attack equal to your Constitution
modifier. You can declare the bonus after the
Dungeon Master has already told you the damage
total. You must wield your staff to benefit from these
features. This form of mastery is useful for all wizards,
particularly if you dabble in both control and
damage-dealing spells.
Wand of Accuracy: Once per encounter as a free
action, you gain a bonus to a single attack roll equal to
your Dexterity modifier. You must wield your wand to
benefit from this feature. This form of mastery is good
for war wizards because it helps increase their accuracy
with damaging powers.
NULL
Ritual Casting
You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat
allowing you to use magical rituals.
NULL
Spellbook
You possess a spellbook, a book full of mystic lore in
which you store your rituals and your daily and utility
spells.
Rituals: Your book contains three 1st-level rituals
of your choice that you have mastered.
 At 5th level, and again at 11th, 15th, 21st, and 25th
level, you master two more rituals of your choice and
add them to your spellbook. Any ritual you add must
be your level or lower.
Daily and Utility Spells: Your spellbook also
holds your daily and utility spells. You begin knowing
two daily spells, one of which you can use on any given
day. Each time you gain a level that lets you select a
daily spell or a utility spell, choose two different daily
spells or utility spells of that level to add to your book.
After an extended rest, you can prepare a number of
daily and utility spells according to what you can cast
per day for your level. You can’t prepare the same spell
twice.
 If you replace a spell because of gaining a level or
through retraining, the previous spell vanishes from
your spellbook and is replaced by the new spell.
   Capacity: A typical spellbook has 128 pages. Each
spell takes up 1 page. A ritual takes up a number of
pages equal to its level.
