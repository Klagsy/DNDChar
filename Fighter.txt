Combat Challenge
Every time you attack an enemy, whether the attack hits or
misses, you can choose to mark the target. The mark lasts
till the end of your next turn. While a target is marked
it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack
that doesnâ€™t include you as a target. Whenever a marked
enemy that is adjacent to you shifts or makes an attack
that does not include you, you can make a melee basic 
attack against that enemy as an immediate interrupt.
